Following the acquisition, Damen then introduced its unique, standardised modular construction concept in Vlissingen too, allowing us to offer very fast delivery times.\n\nWe have delivered more than 400 vessels since 1875 to satisfied customers all over the world and have earned a reputation for excellence along the way.

Many more customers prefer to use local yards these days for reasons to develop their national shipbuilding capabilities through the transfer of skills and technology. DSNS has responded to this by adapting its processes to enable them to benefit from Damen expertise and support while using their own preferred yards. Everything from design and manufacturing to construction and project management has been optimised for local production.\n\nAn important step before the start of any local build project is determining the capabilities of the yard involved. Once that is established Damen can provide a suitable package based on the provision of all necessary documentation including complete drawing sets, and the delivery of materials and components on time and in sequence.\n\nThis can be done for any naval vessel. Construction can also take place in more than one yard with different modules being built at different locations and then transported to a single yard for final assembly and commissioning.\nIn today\'s rapidly changing world, it is important to stay ahead of developments.

During the dismantling of the vessel as scrap, metal materials are evaluated directly or sent to mill.\nShip Recycling converts scrap to valuable goods and recycles used natural resources.\nOn the other hand Ship Recycling holds its place between industries which protect the environment.  \nFor the purpose of effective and efficient use of natural resources, scrap vessels will be dismantled and processed to obtain various products.\nThe Ship Recycling plays an active role in maintaining the ecological balance and IMO International Maritime Organization accepted it and it is also known as\'\' green industry\'\'.\nComparing the iron ore extraction from the nature with smelting and rolling  you can see that ship recycling  provides huge energy and cost savings and less pollution.\nThe alternative for steel production from scrap ships is the produce this from iron ores.

Each of the three raw materials are produced out of the furnaces above earth ground, this devastates the large earth.\nCoke is produced out of converted coal with appropriate specifications.\nCoke turns partly to carbondioxide and partly to iron carbide.
